# CIS-410

When the start button is pressed a random color of balloon game will appear.

You have 10 seconds to press F enough times to pop the balloon, if you do when the 10 seconds are up you will not lose a life.

If you fail to press F enough you will lose a life when the 10 seconds runs out.

A new random color of balloon game that you have not played will load if you have >1 lives left and you still havent played all 4 versions.

If one of those is not the case ie (lives <1 or you've played all 4 version of balloon game (red, blue, yellow, green)) the game will end.
